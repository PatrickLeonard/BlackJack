## Synopsis

Simple command line based blackjack game. The object of the game is to get to closer to 21 (without going over) than the dealer. Cards are worth their face value and the suited cards are worth 10. The first A is worth 11, subsequent A's are worth 1. The player is able to bet and win "money" and only plays against the "computer." Have a great time playing.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about C++ and it was also the subject of a college class for using C++ to create games. It was a first-year course in computer programming and object oriented programmming. 

## Installation

Compile using your favorite C++ compiler and execute the program on the command line, or you can try the makefile that is included and then execute the program.
